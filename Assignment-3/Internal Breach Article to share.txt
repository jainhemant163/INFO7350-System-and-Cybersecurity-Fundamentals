Computer frameworks are delicate to natural conditions. Natural controls to protect computer frameworks include: Cool temperatures to secure equipment from being harmed by overheating. Humidity control to keep stickiness over 50% to maintain a strategic distance from electric shock. Moisture locators to recognize the nearness of water and give early cautions to anticipate water/flood damage from water channels and sprinklers. Fire concealment controls to anticipate harm from warm and smoke.
